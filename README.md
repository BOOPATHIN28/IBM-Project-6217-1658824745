##                                      Project Objectives:
         * Know fundamental concepts and techniques of the Artificial Neural Network and Convolution Neural Networks.
         * Gain a broad understanding of image data.
         * Work with Sequential type of modeling
         * Work with Keras capabilities
         * Work with image processing techniques
         * know how to build a web application using the Flask framework.
##                                    Project Flow:
         >  User interacts with User interface to upload image
         >  Uploaded image is analyzed by the model which is integrated
         >  Once model analyses the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI
###          To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below
###        >        Data Collection.
       Collect the dataset or Create the dataset
###    > Data Preprocessing.
1.Import the ImageDataGenerator library
2.Configure ImageDataGenerator class
3.Apply ImageDataGenerator functionality to Trainset and Testset
###   > Model Building
